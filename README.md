# to-do-list
A to-do list website where users can add, edit, and delete tasks using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Implementation of the core functionality is done using JavaScript and we ensure that the application is responsive and visually appealing.This provides a clear way for users to interact with tasks.

Requirements:
1. Users will be able to add new tasks, edit existing tasks, delete tasks, and mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
2. Tasks eould be stored locally so that they are retained even if the user closes the browser.
3. We ocus on improving the user interface for a seamless and intuitive user experience.

These are the snapshots of how the to-do list page looks like:
